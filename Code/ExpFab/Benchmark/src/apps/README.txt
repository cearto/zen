APPLICATIONS
============

groupSegEval
  To evaluate segmentations of the same object (for within-benchmark
  evaluation) 
  Usage: groupSegEval fnMesh dirIn dirOut modelId nSegs [options]
  
iseg
  Interactive mesh segmentation program used by us to collect manual
  segmentations from Mturk
  Usage: iseg fnMesh fnSeg [options]

msh2msh
  To convert mesh files between difference formats ("ply", "off", "obj")
  Usage: msh2msh fnMeshIn fnMeshOut [options]

mshinfo
  Show mesh information including nFaces, nVertices, nEdges, Segmentation
  info(optional), etc.
  Usage: mshinfo fnMesh [-seg fnSeg] 

mshview
  To view a mesh 
  Usage: mshview fnMesh [-seg fnSeg] [options]

outputSegments
  To output all vertices of each segment in a segmented mesh (as .segment
  file), could be used as inputs to QHull.
  Usage: outputSegments fnMesh [-seg fnSeg] dirOutput [-v]

segAnalysis
  To analysis properties of segmentations 
  Usage:segAnalysis fnMesh -id id -nFilesIn N -dirStat nameDirStat -dirIn nameDirIn [options]

segEval 
  To compare two mesh segmentations quantitatively 
  Usage: segEval fnMesh fnSeg fnSegRef dirStat [options] 

segPreprocess
  To pre-process segmentations generated by algorithms. It maps the input
  segmentation fnSegIn on the input mesh fnMeshIn to the geometry of fnMeshOut
  and fnSegOut accordingly. It also makes sure that each segment is a single
  component.    
  Usage: segPreprocess fnMeshIn fnSegIn fnSegOut fnMeshOut [options]
