This program pre-processes segmentations generated by algorithms by mapping 
segmentation to the mesh geometry in fnMeshOut, and separating each segment to 
contain only one component.

Usage: segPreprocess fnMeshIn fnSegIn fnSegOut fnMeshOut [options]
======
fnMeshIn : path to the input mesh geometry
fnSegIn : segmentation on fnMeshIn
fnSegOut : output segmentation on fnMeshOut
fnMeshOut : path to the desired mesh geometry
[options]
  -v : output more information during running 
  -debug : output debug information during running
